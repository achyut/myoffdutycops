                           The Dallas Cowboys began their first practice of training camp by paying tribute to the Dallas Police Department and family members of the officers killed in the recent shootings downtown. <br>
Dallas Police Chief David Brown, Mayor Mike Rawlings and 13 family members linked arms with Cowboys players and walked quietly out onto the field, forming a circle. Brown and Rawlings then addressed the team.  At the end of his talk and Brown pumped his fist and exclaimed: "Dallas Strong!".

                          Instead of traffic tickets, one Georgia police officer dished out something much sweeter to the people he pulled over — ice cream.
                          <br/>
When Officer Ed Smith of the Warner Robins Police Department stopped people for driving infractions last week, he gave them all a Dairy Queen Blizzard and let them go with a warning.

                        <p>
                         A picture of a young boy celebrating his birthday with Oklahoma City police officers is going viral.

Last week, officials with the Oklahoma Department of Human Services say a young boy had to be removed from his home due to an unsafe situation.

When officers took the boy into protective custody, they learned not only was it his birthday, but that he had never been given a party or birthday cake in his life.

                        The Fort Worth Police Department swore in their newest group of cadets Thursday morning—16 children fighting cancer and other serious illnesses.
At the ceremony, each child was outfitted in their own police uniform and received a badge that read “real hero” from a receiving line of Fort Worth officers. Damon Cole, the Fort Worth officer who dresses up as superheroes and visits children in the hospital, organized an entire day of “training” activities for the junior officers.
